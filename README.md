# Automatic Face Capture and Recognition

This repository contains a Python-based implementation for automatic face capture and recognition using a webcam. It uses DeepFace for face embeddings and MongoDB for storing and retrieving embeddings for recognition. The system performs real-time face capture, generates embeddings, and compares them with pre-stored embeddings in the database.
